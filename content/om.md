The developer of this site is Emelie Åslund, whom is 25 years old and lives in Ekerö, Sweden. She's currently working at Lidl as a non-food specialist while studying webprogramming through
Blekinge Tekniska Högskola. She loves animals, especially dogs. She has one herself, called Max. He's a mix-breed of Siberian Husky, Norbottenspets, Finnish Lappdog and Samoyed. Max is the neighbourhoods favorite dog, he loves everyone - perhaps a little too much at times!
